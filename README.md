to create a table storing chat conversations of different people(fb messanger)
I need logic to create a table for conversation between two people if not exists.
Example:
person1: chandu -ID-1
person2: vishva -ID-2


if chandu want to send a message to vishva it should open the same chat which vishva has sent a message to chandu using unique ID.
